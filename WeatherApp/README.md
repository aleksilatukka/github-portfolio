# Weather App with Java and Apache NetBeans
This application utilizes the power of JavaFX and [OpenWeatherMap's](https://openweathermap.org/) API to provide you with up-to-date weather forecasts for any location worldwide. With a simple and intuitive interface, WeatherApp allows you to search for cities and instantly retrieve detailed weather data.
To use this you need your own APIkey from the [site](https://openweathermap.org/api), and you need to insert your key to WeatherApp.java (lines 25 and 66).

### TODO

May your days be filled with sunny skies, gentle breezes, and the warmth of the sun's embrace. Here's to clear forecasts and bright horizons ahead!
